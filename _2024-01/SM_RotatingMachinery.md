The Rotating Machinery library allows you to test novel designs or identify faults in machinery such as turbines, motors and drivelines. It contains critical components, such as bearings, gears, flexible shafts, and discs, with high precision. By utilizing this library, you can compare different designs to understand their effects, such as vibrations, deflections and contact stresses, among other things.

Some of the key features are:
- Pre-configured high-fidelity models for bearings, gears, shafts, disks and supports.
- Create custom bearings using catalogs from manufacturers like SKF, NSK, KOYO, TIMKEN, and FAG.
- Simulate contact forces between spur gears based on the Hertzian Contact theory.
- Flexible components enabling you to observe deformations.
- Fully compatible with Modelica MultiBody library with the same connectors.
