The Rotating Machinery library allows you to test novel designs or identify faults in rotating machinery such as turbines, motors and drivelines. Within the library, you'll find fundamental components of rotating machinery, such as gears, shafts and bearings. These components are designed to be flexible, enabling you to observe deformations and accurately capture real-world responses under different loads.

Some of the key features are:
- Pre-configured high-fidelity models for bearings, gears, shafts, disks and supports
- Built-in animation of all models, providing an easy visual check of your modeling process
- Allows the combination of components from the Modelica Standard Library
